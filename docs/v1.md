# IColor Version 1: Design

IColor is a simple example of how to split jobs between upstream and downstream
jobs. The premise is simple: IColor is an interface that implements `Run()`.
Upstream services generate IColor types and send them to downstream services
that execute `Run()`. The `Response` value is then sent to the executing
function.
